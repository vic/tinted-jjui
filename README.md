# tinted-jjui -- jjui themes generated from [base16](https://nico-i.github.io/scheme-viewer/base16/) and [base24](https://nico-i.github.io/scheme-viewer/base24/) color schemes.


## Usage

Download any of the `.toml` files from `./colors/` and place it
in your `$HOME/.config/jjui/themes/` directory.

Then edit `$HOME/.config/jjui/config.toml` to set your theme.

For example, to use `./colors/base16-rebecca.toml`:


```toml
[ui]
theme = "base16-rebecca"
```

This will set jjui colors to use [vic](https://x.com/oeiuwq)'s [rebecca-purple](https://github.com/vic/rebecca-theme) [base16](https://github.com/vic/base16-rebecca)
